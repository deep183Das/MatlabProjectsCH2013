This session had taken place on 27th September, 2023. Discussion of methods of finding roots of simultaneous equations (in matrix form) :
<br/>
i. Gauss-Jordan  (using in-built function "rref" get the RREF of the matrix) 
<br/>
ii. Gauss-Seidel 
<br/>
iii. Jacobi-Iterative 
<br/> 
<br/>
And to solve a single variable polynomial equation, even for its complex roots if it has using "Muller's Method".
