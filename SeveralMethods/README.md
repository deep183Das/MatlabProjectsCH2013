Here various methods are discussed for how to solve an equation using "fsolve" or other way around. 
<br/>
1>> *func01* : how to create a local function to evaluate the values of interest by solving a certain expression  <br />
2>> *func02* : same as *func01*, but here for a range of given values, the corresponding values of the expression are calculated  <br />
3>> *func03* : passing a matrix(containing range of values) to the local function and here ".(dot)" operator is used on the vector  <br />
4>> *func04* : difference between element by element operation and operation on a whole vector as a whole  <br />
5>> *func05* to *func08* : how to use "fsolve()" function, different options to use in it and solving for equations  <br />
6>> *func09* to *func10* : how to solve simultaneous equations 
7>> *func11* : use of "fzero()" & "roots()"
