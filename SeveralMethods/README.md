Here various methods are discussed for how to solve an equation using "fsolve" or other way around. 
<br />
1> *func1* : how to create a local function to evaluate the values of interest by solving a certain expression  <br />
2> *func2* : same as *func1*, but here for a range of given values, the corresponding values of the expression are calculated  <br />
3> *func3* : passing a matrix(containing range of values) to the local function and here ".(dot)" operator is used on the vector  <br />
4> *func4* : difference between element by element operation and operation on a whole vector as a whole  <br />
5> *func5* to *func8* : how to use "fsolve()" function, different options to use in it and solving for equations  <br />
6> *func9* to *func10* : how to solve simultaneous equations
