This session had taken place on 16th August, 2023. "Newton-Raphson"/(modified N-R) and "Bisection" methods are used to find roots of complicated functions. <br/>

There is a problem in the solution for the question 4. What is needed is we can't change the initial guess value at any time, from that one guess value, using N-R method we've to find all the roots.
