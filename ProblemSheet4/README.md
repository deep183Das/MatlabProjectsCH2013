This session had taken place on 30th August, 2023. "fsolve" & "Newton-Raphson methods are used to find roots of expressions & equations and also solving of simultaneous equations.
<br/>
In the ProblemSheet, some changes need to be considered, which are as follows : <br/>
<br/>
*Question_1* : 
<br/>
a> In both the expressions of "b", in place of "T(Temperature in K)", "Tc(Critical Temperature)" should be used.  <br/>
b> In the Redlich-Kwong equation of state, in the second term in RHS of the equation, there should be V*((V+b)^2)*(T^(0.5)). <br/>
<br/>
*Question_2* :
<br/>
a> In the expression of K2(in terms of extent of reactions), in the numerator the espression will be (e2)*((e1 + 2*e2)^2) and rest is unchanged.
